#Flappy Cube: A WebGL clone of the Flappy Bird gameplay!

Author: Huilong

This is my WebGL clone of the Flappy Bird game using Three.js.

The basics of WebGL and HTML appearance are based on [Nikhil Suresh's cool tutorial of WebGL 3D Pong game](http://buildnewgames.com/webgl-threejs/).

Check out my GitHub repository for the source code. It's commented in detail for further modification and remake. 

Chrome, FireFox or IE11 is recommended to play (It seems to me that certain FireFox versions have error loading WebGL context).
